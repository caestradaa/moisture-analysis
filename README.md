# Project: Pasta Moisture Data Analysis
*Exploratory data analysis on pasta moisture (food industry) for manufacturing efficiency improvement.*

## Overview
- In this research work, a deep analysis on the moisture data of pasta in a food factory was carried out, in order to answer questions and help make decisions to improve the efficiency of the pasta drying process.
- Data obtained from moisture testers through an IOT data capture system and stored on a csv file. 2 final datasets, 14.121 rows.
- Project tools: Power BI for ETL and graphics, Infostat for statistics, Excel.
- Important insights:
- Built a formal report.

### Code and Resourses Used

## Problem statement and hypothesis
The challenge of the pasta drying process is to be able to obtain the highest possible moisture results in the finished product without entailing a risk of non-conforming product by exceeding the maximum legal level of 13.00%. The objective of the production team, and the business in general, is to reach the range of 12.30% - 12.50%.

Today, the general humidity indicator fails to meet that goal with 12.15%.

This data analytical approach was made to answering the quiestions what was happening? and what is happening in the actual pasta drying process ?. Yhi
Some of the most importants are:
- Which production line/pasta format has the most variant moisture results? Which pasta format tends to be dryer? Which of then has best improvement oportunities?
- Does the weight of the pasta samples (taken from the production line) have any significant impact on the results of the moisture testers?
